# Artificial-Neural-Networks-
Analysing and validating the outputs and modelled functions of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of predictive, replicative and structural validity.

The ann function is a method for training single hidden layer MLPs with a specified model structure (i.e. number of hidden layer nodes, hidden and output layer activation functions).
