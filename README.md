# Artificial-Neural-Networks-
Analysing and validating the outputs and modelled functions of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of predictive, replicative and structural validity.

The ann function is a method for training single hidden layer MLPs with a specified model structure (i.e. number of hidden layer nodes, hidden and output layer activation functions).

This function is similar to the available nnet function from package nnet; however, it gives greater flexiblity by providing a choice between four alternative activation functions for the hidden and output layer nodes, including the logistic sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), linear (or identity) and exponential functions, as well as allowing a user-defined error or objective function.
